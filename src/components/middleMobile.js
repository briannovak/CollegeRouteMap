Four years later, the day before my son graduated, I was so thankful for what I learned in pre-college workshop that I sought out Dr. Ederer to tell him what a difference his advice made for all of us, especially my son. He was my third child to attend college, I wish I had heard him before any of my children went away to school!"</p></div>
