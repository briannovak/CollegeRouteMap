# overview
This is the front end site for College Route Map, the overall focus was to make a responsive site, with views specifically designed with CSS media queries for specific apple devices as most users will more than likely be viewing content from those device.

##Landing Page
There is a super header that disappears on scroll and a regular navbar that appears after scrolling.

##Landing Page Events!!!!
The scroll event for the super header is defined in the App.js page and determines the classes for the superheader and navbar. ***This is the most complicated part of the site.***

##Quirks
With the screen at greater than 1024 px scroll down so the superheader disappears and then make the browser smaller and the navbar will collapse appropriately.

##Contact Forms
I planned on using formspree.io for the contact forms to in order to avoid writing a back end for now.

##Mobile Nav
The components for a mobile nav have been created and did work; however, making the super header hide and show along with the mobile nav has not been completed.

##Payments
In the worksops page we discussed forwarding to either square or paypal in order to sign up and pay for the workshop

##CSS
The CSS was written for specific breaks designed mostly with apple devices; however, they will also work with all other devices. The layouts with most need of work were the vertical ipad views.
